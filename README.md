Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data

Project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


DEVELOPMENT

NOTES: ******* CLEANED VARAIBLE NAES BY REMOVING THE '()' CHARACTERS FROM LABELS. VARIABLES ARE PLAINLY SELF-EXPLANATORY
       ******* FILTERED OUT 'MEAN FREQUENCY' VARIABLES, SINCE THEY ARE A CALCULATION FROM ORIGINAL MEASUREMENTS

Please make sure you have the decompressed folder "UCI HAR Dataset" containing the data in your working directory

the code requires the DPLYR and TIDYR packages to run seamlessly. The code includes will make sure those packages are installed.

To run the code use:
source("run_analysis.R") -- it was tested both in RStudio(Version 0.99.467) and R (Version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18))

After the code is run a file named "data_clean.txt" will be created in the working directory
The independent tidy dataset with the average for each subject, activity, variable is: "data_cln_AVG"


--- COOKBOOK ---
The following are the steps in which the code is going to ressovle:


## LOADS DPLYR/TIDYR PACKAGES IN CASE RUNNING COMPUTER DOES NOT HAVE THEM
## CREATE VARIABLES TO GET COLUMN NAMES / ACTIVITY DESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL FILES
## STARTS LOOP TO PREPARE/MERGE THE DATA COMING FROM BOTH TEST AND TRAIN FOLDERS
## LIST SUB-FOLDERS IN "UCI HAR Dataset" WITHIN THE WORKING DIRECTORY [getwd()]
## HARDCODED ROOT TO DATA FOLDER ROOTS FOR THE TEST AND TRAIN FOLDERS
## HARDCODED FILE NAMES (2nd FRAGMENT) DEPENDING ON THE ROOT FOLDER WHERE THE
## DATA IS BEING FETCHED
## LOOP FOR FOLDER ROOT AND FILE NAME (2nd FRAGMENT) 
## LOOP INSIDE EACH SUB-FOLDER TO READ DATA FROM *.TXT FILES	 
## HARDCODED FILE NAMES (1st FRAGMENT) DEPENDING ON THE ROOT FOLDER WHERE THE
## DATA IS BEING FETCHED
## CREATE VECTORS TO CONTAIN THE ASSEMBLY AND COMPLETE ROOT TO FILES
## FILES ROOT AND FILE NAME CONSTRUCTION - 
## LOOP TO ASSIGN THE VARIABLE NAME TO READ EACH DATA FILE
## READ DATA FROM *.TXT FILES AND CREATE A DATAFRAME VARIABLE WITH THE DATA
## ASSIGN COLUMN NAMES TO EACH DATAFRAME RESULTING FROM THE LOOP
## BIND DATAFRAMES INTO ONE PER TYPE - TEST AND TRAIN
## JOIN MERGED DATASET TO ACTIVITY LABELS TO USE THE DESCRIPTIVE ACTIVITY NAMES
## FILTER TO COLUMNS CONTAINING "MEAN" OR "STD" - TAKE OUT THOSE CALCULATING FREQUENCY
## CREATE A LONG VERSION OF TEH DATASET TO SIMPLIFY THE LAST STEP OF PROJECT
## WRITE *.TXT FILE WITH CLEAN DATASET
## CREATE INDEPENDENT TIDY DATASET WITH THE AVERAGE OF EACH VARIABLE FOR EACH ACTIVITY AND EACH SUBJECT
